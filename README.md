# CUDA Image Batch Pipeline

**Scope:** Batch edge-enhancement (NPP grayscale → custom CUDA Sobel → NPP box blur) on ≥300 images; outputs PGM and a log.

## Build & Run (to be filled in next steps)
- Build: (coming in Step 2)
- Run:   (coming in Step 2)

## Data
- Small sample images in `data/` (to be added).
- Outputs (PGM + log) in `outputs/`.

## What this demonstrates
- Batch processing at scale (many small images).
- Combination of CUDA kernel + NPP primitives.

## Proof of execution & results
- See `outputs/` (to be added).

## Lessons learned / limitations
- (Fill after experiments)
